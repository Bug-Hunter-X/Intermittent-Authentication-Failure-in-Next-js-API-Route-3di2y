# Next.js API Route Authentication Issue

This repository demonstrates an intermittent authentication failure in a Next.js API route using `unstable_getServerSession`.  The issue is that the session object sometimes returns `undefined` despite a valid user session.

## Problem Description

The API route attempts to authenticate using `unstable_getServerSession`.  Inconsistent behaviour is observed, whereby sometimes the `session` object is correctly populated with user details, and other times it's unexpectedly `undefined`, resulting in an 'Unauthorized' error.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Test the API route and observe the intermittent failures.

## Solution

The issue might stem from various factors. This repo offers a possible solution addressing one such cause that addresses timing-related inconsistencies during the server-side session retrieval process.
